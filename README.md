## Installation Requirements

* [Frontity installation requirements](https://docs.frontity.org/getting-started#installation-requirements)
* [WP Job Openings Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-job-openings/)
* An add-on(plugin) for WP Job Openings plugin or custom functions added in theme's fuctions.php file to expose application form and other fields to WP REST API. You can use [WP Job Openings REST API (Example) Plugin](https://github.com/awsmin/wp-job-openings-rest-api-example) for reference.

## Setup

1. Install the package
2. Add it to Frontity Settings

    Add the package to `frontity.settings.js` inside the `packages` array.

    ```
    const settings = {
        ...
        "packages": [
            ...
            // If no settings need to be added.
            "@awsmin/frontity-wp-job-openings",

            // If you want to add settings.
            {
                "name": "@awsmin/frontity-wp-job-openings",
                // Add your settings here.
            },
            ...
        ]
    };

    export default settings;
    ```

3. Enable Custom Post Types support.

    In the `@frontity/wp-source` package settings you have to add the `postTypes` option for enabling support for custom post type.

    ```
    const settings = {
        ...
        "packages": [
            ...
            {
                "name": "@frontity/wp-source",
                "state": {
                    "source": {
                        "api": "https://example.com/wp-json",
                        "postTypes": [
                            {
                                "type": "awsm_job_openings",
                                "endpoint": "awsm_job_openings",
                                "archive": "/jobs"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            },
            ...
        ]
    };

    export default settings;
    ```

    Now, when you access the `/jobs` you will get all the job listings (after you run `npx frontity dev` command). If you have used different slug for the archive page then you may have to use that instead of `/jobs`.

    Due to some current limitations of the `@frontity/wp-source`, you may also have to add a custom redirection to the `index.js` file in your theme package. If your slug is different you have to replace `jobs` with your custom slug.

    ```
    const jobsRedirect = {
        name: "awsm_job_openings",
        pattern: "/jobs/:slug",
        func: ({ slug }) => `/awsm_job_openings/${slug}/`
    };
    ```

    Then, add it to the `redirections` array inside `libraries.source`. For example, if you are using the Frontity Mars Theme:

    ```
        const marsTheme = {
            name: "@frontity/mars-theme",
            ...
            libraries: {
                ...
                source: {
                    redirections: [jobsRedirect]
                }
            }
        };

        export default marsTheme;
    ```

That's it! Now, when you run the `npx frontity dev` you can access the job listings from the jobs archive page(e.g. `/jobs`). You can use [WP Job Openings REST API (Example) Plugin](https://github.com/awsmin/wp-job-openings-rest-api-example) for retrieving job specifications and using it in your frontity theme package.

## Limitations

Currently, the form submission doesn't use the WP REST API. It uses the `admin-ajax.php` URL.

### CORS Issue

Since, we use the `admin-ajax.php` URL, you may encounter the CORS Issue. An error: `TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.` will be thrown in the console and the Cross-Origin request will be blocked.

**Solution:**

You can use the `allowed_http_origins` filter hook to add allowed HTTP origins. For example:

```
function awsm_allowed_http_origins( $origins ) {
    $origins[] = 'https://example.com';
    return $origins;
}
add_filter( 'allowed_http_origins', 'awsm_allowed_http_origins' );
```
